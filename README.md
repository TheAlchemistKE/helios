## **About Helios**

Helios is a powerful, statically-typed programming language designed with simplicity, readability, and performance in mind. It is inspired by modern programming languages but focuses on providing a minimalistic approach with modern tooling.

**Key Features:**
- **Static Typing**: Helios ensures strong type safety at compile-time, reducing runtime errors and improving code quality.
- **Simplicity**: Helios syntax is concise, making it easy to read and write code.
- **Concurrency**: Built-in support for handling concurrent operations, enabling efficient execution in parallel workloads.
- **Modularity**: Helios encourages modular development through its package system.

## **Features**

This repository contains the following core features:

- **Core Application Logic**: The primary logic and business rules implemented using Helios.
- **API Endpoints**: RESTful API endpoints that communicate with the Helios backend.
- **CLI Tooling**: A command-line interface (CLI) to help you interact with and manipulate the application.
- **Testing Suite**: A comprehensive set of unit and integration tests to ensure code correctness.
- **Documentation**: Detailed comments, tutorials, and explanations throughout the codebase to help you get started.

## **Installation**

Follow these steps to install and set up the Helios project locally:

### Prerequisites

- **Helios Language**: You need the Helios compiler installed on your machine. You can download it from the [official Helios website](https://www.helioslang.org).
- **Git**: Make sure you have Git installed on your computer to clone this repository.
- **Go** (if necessary for additional tooling): We may use Go for additional tooling around the project.

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/helios-project.git
   cd helio-project
**Install Helios compiler:**

Follow the instructions at helioslang.org to install the Helios compiler.

**Build the project:**

Use the Helios compiler to build the project. This will compile your source code into an executable or application.

```bash

helios build
Run the application:
```

After building, you can start the project by running:

```bash

helios run main.helios
```
This will launch the application and start listening on the appropriate ports or executing the CLI commands.

### Usage
This section explains how to use the project once it's set up.

### Running the Application

Once you've successfully built the project, you can run the main application using the following command:

```bash

helios run main.helios
```
Example Commands
If this project contains a command-line tool, here are some sample commands:

bash
Copy code
helios run server
helios run tests
helios build --release
helios deploy --production
API Documentation
If your project exposes any APIs, describe them here. For example:

POST /api/v1/resource: This endpoint creates a new resource.
Request body:
```json
{
"name": "Resource Name",
"description": "A description of the resource."
}
```
Response:
```json
{
"id": "12345",
"name": "Resource Name"
}
```
Refer to the API documentation for more detailed usage instructions.
